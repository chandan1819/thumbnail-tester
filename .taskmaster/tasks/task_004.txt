# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Dummy Video Feed
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Load and display dummy video data with thumbnails.
# Details:
Create a JSON file containing dummy video data (channel icon, video title, views, timestamp, thumbnail URLs). Load this data and render it in the video feed. Use local caching to improve performance. Display 3 thumbnails per row.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the dummy video data is loaded correctly and displayed in the video feed. Check the performance of the feed with local caching enabled.

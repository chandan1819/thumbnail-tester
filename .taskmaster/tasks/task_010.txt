# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Backend File Validation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement backend file validation to prevent malicious uploads.
# Details:
Set up a simple backend endpoint (e.g., using Node.js with Express) to handle file uploads. Implement file validation (size, dimensions, format) on the server-side. Return an error if the file is invalid.

# Test Strategy:
Test file upload with valid and invalid files. Verify that the backend validation works correctly and returns an error for invalid files.

# Thumbnail Tester

This is a Next.js application that allows users to upload and preview YouTube thumbnails in a realistic layout before publishing them. It helps content creators choose the best thumbnail by visualizing how it will appear on the YouTube platform.

## How it works

1.  **Upload Thumbnails**: Drag and drop or click to upload up to 3 thumbnail images (PNG, JPG, up to 5MB).
2.  **Preview**: After uploading, you are redirected to a testing page.
3.  **Visualize**: See your uploaded thumbnails in a list of dummy YouTube video cards to see how they look in a real-world scenario.
4.  **Choose**: Compare the thumbnails and pick the one that stands out the most.

## Features
